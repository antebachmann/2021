    "##  Some rules\n",
    "\n",
    "1. You are allowed to use any built-in Python library that comes with Anaconda. If you want to use an external library, \n",
    "you may do so, but must justify your choice.\n",
    "2. Make sure you use the `data` folder provided in the repository in read-only mode. (Or alternatively, be sure you \n",
    "don’t change any of the files.)\n",
    "3. Be sure to provide a textual description of your thought process, the assumptions you made, the solution you \n",
    "implemented, and explanations for your answers. A notebook that only has code cells will not suffice.\n",
    "4. For questions containing the **/Discuss:/** prefix, answer not with code, but with a textual explanation\n",
    " (**in markdown**).\n",
    "5. Back up any hypotheses and claims with data, since this is an important aspect of the course.\n",
    "6. Please write all your comments in English, and use meaningful variable names in your code. Your repo should have a \n",
    "single notebook (plus the required data files) in the *master/main* branch. If there are multiple notebooks present, \n",
    "we will **not grade** anything.\n",
    "7. We will **not run your notebook for you**! Rather, we will grade it as is, which means that only the results \n",
    "contained in your evaluated code cells will be considered, and we will not see the results in unevaluated code cells. \n",
    "Thus, be sure to hand in a **fully-run and evaluated notebook**. In order to check whether everything looks as intended, you can check the rendered notebook on the GitHub website once you have pushed your solution there.\n",
    "8. In continuation to the previous point, interactive plots, such as those generated using `plotly`, should be **strictly avoided**!\n",
    "9. Make sure to print results or dataframes that confirm you have properly addressed the task.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",

    "## Context\n",
    "\n",
    "Congratulations! You have just been hired as a data scientist at *Piccardi Music,* a promising new music label created by a mysterious Italian disc jockey \"*Signor Piccardi*\". The company hired you to carry out a variety of data-related tasks, which will be explained in further detail below.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## The data\n",
    "\n",
    "For this homework you will use a dataset of 18,403 music reviews scraped from Pitchfork¹, including relevant metadata such as review author, review date, record release year, review score, and genre, along with the respective album's audio features pulled from Spotify's API. The data consists of the following columns:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Column   | Description  |\n",
    "|----------|:-------------|\n",
    "| `artist`           | The name of the artist who created the album being reviewed. |\n",
    "| `album`            | The name of the album being reviewed. |\n",
    "| `recordlabel`      | The name of the record label(s) who published the album. |\n",
    "| `releaseyear`      | The year that the album was released. |\n",
    "| `score`            | The score given to the album by the reviewer on a scale of 0.0 to 10.0. |\n",
    "| `reviewauthor`     | The name of the author who reviewed the album. |\n",
    "| `genre`            | The genre assigned to the album by Pitchfork. |\n",
    "| `reviewdate`       | The date that the review was published.  |\n",
    "| `key` | The estimated overall musical key of the track. Integers map to pitches using standard Pitch Class notation (e.g., 0 = C, 2 = D, and so on) |\n",
    "| `acousticness` | A confidence measure from 0.0 to 1.0 of whether an album is acoustic. 1.0 represents high confidencethat the album is acoustic. |\n",
    "| `danceability` | How suitable an album is for dancing based on a combination of musical elements including tempo, rhythm stability, beat strength, and overall regularity. A value of 1.0 is most danceable.\n",
    "| `energy` | A perceptual measure of intensity and activity, from 0.0 to 1.0, where 1.0 represents high energy. Metal is often high energy. |\n",
    "| `instrumentalness` | Predicts whether an album contains no vocals, from 0.0 to 1.0. The closer to 1.0, the more likely the album contains no vocals. |\n",
    "| `liveness` | Detects the presence of an audience, from 0.0 to 1.0. Scores greater than 0.8 indicate a strong likelihood the album is live. |\n",
    "| `loudness` | The overall loudness of the album in decibels (dB). |\n",
    "| `speechiness` | Measures the presence of spoken words in an album on a scale from 0.0 to 1.0. Scores higher than 0.66 indicate an album made entirely of spoken words, while scores below 0.33 indicate music and other non-speech-like elements. |\n",
    "| `valence` | A measure from 0.0 to 1.0 describing the musical positiveness conveyed by an album, where values closer to 1.0 indicate more positive sounds. |\n",
    "| `tempo` | The overall estimated tempo of an album in beats per minute (BPM). |\n",

    "Next, you decide to prepare the code that will help you in training your machine learning models. Also, you implement a simple baseline. For this task, **unless otherwise stated** you must implement functions yourself, instead of relying on `scikit-learn` (you can use `numpy` or `pandas`, though!).\n",
    "\n",
    "1. For each possible value in the `genre` column, create a new column called `{genre}_onehot` (e.g., for `genre=jazz`, create `jazz_onehot`). Collectively, these new columns should \"one hot-encode\" the genre column—for instance, if for a given album the `genre` is filled with the value `jazz`, the `jazz_onehot` column should equal 1 and all other `{genre}_onehot` columns should equal 0. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Create a function `numpy_helper(df, cols)` to obtain a `numpy.array` out of your `dataframe`. The function should receive a dataframe `df` with N rows and a list of M columns `cols`, and should return a `np.array` of dimension (NxM).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. For each album, build an array of features `X` containing all genre-related one-hot features, and an array of outcomes `y` containing scores. Using the function [`sklearn.model_selection.train_test_split`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.train_test_split.html) with `random_state=123`, split the data into a train set containing 70% of all data, and a test set containing the remaining 30%.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Create your own baseline regressor. Using the training data (in the training stage), your regressor should estimate the average score for all albums. Then, for the test data (in the prediction stage), your classifier should always output the average score (computed on the training data).\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Calculate the [coefficient of determination ($R^2$)](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.r2_score.html) of your baseline on the test data. **You are allowed to use the `sklearn` implementation here.**\n",

Second, assign 1 to the 20% most distant 1st-2nd album pairs and 0 to all others.\n",
